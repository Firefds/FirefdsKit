## Attention
This version was tested by the community and not by me, as I don't have an Android 10 Samsung device.
**THERE COULD BE BUGS/CRASHES/BOOTLOOPS**, but it's pretty stable.
Please upload any xposed logs when you encounter any issue. I can't help you without the logs!
Confirmed working on:
- Galaxy S9
- Note 9
- Galaxy S10

## Installation

To install this module you need the following apps and modules installed on your device:
1. Magisk v19 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases
2. Magisk Manager v7.5.1 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases
3. Riru Magisk module v19.6 and above - https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases

5. EdXposed Installer v4.5.4 and above - https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXp...nager/releases

## Known Issues

- Some features are removed on purpose. Since GravityBox has been working on Samsung Oreo devices without much issues, I only implemented features that need special Samsung coding. You can check [GravityBox for Q](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v10-0-0-beta-1-android-10-t3974497) for additional features.
- Changes between EdXposed versions 4xxx and 5xxx will result in app settings lost.
